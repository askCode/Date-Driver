A Date program is a staple for those who use a command line interface. 
You will now get to write your own. 
In order to do this, you will need to create two related classes (in two files) 
that contain at least the following::

DateDriver: Main class This is the "Driver Class" that tests out the DateAD class described below. methods:

� public static void main -- takes 0, 1 (day-of-the-month), 
                                   2 (a day-of-the-month, month) or 
                                   3 (a day-of-the-month, month, year) 
                                   COMMAND LINE arguments, 
                                   creates a DateAD object (see class definition below) and prints :

o the given date

o the day before

o the day after

o the current date

o an indication if the given date is in the past, present or future

0 parameters should make the date be the current date

1 parameter should make the date be the current date, with day changed if valid; 
  current date otherwise

2 parameters should make the date be the current date with day and month changed if both are valid; 
  current date otherwise

3 parameters should make the date match input if all are valid; 
  current date otherwise non-numeric arguments should be ignored (as well as all arguments after non-numeric)

DateAD: contains information about a single date -- this class will be re-used in further assignments. 
Instead of just using the built in "Date" class (the one in java.util), 
you will write and use your own. properties:

� public static finals (constants) for

o lowest year allowed (1760 works well -- a leap year just after Gregorian calendar starts in 1752)

o starting day-of-the-week for counting (January 1 of 1760 was a Tuesday)

o months in a year (12)

o days in a week (7)

o an array of month-names ( [0] is "January", etc.)

o an array of day-of-week-names ( [0] is "Sunday", etc.)

� private short year -- the full year (1760+)

� private short month -- (0 - 11)

� private short dayOfMonth -- (1 - <numberOfDaysInTheMonth>)

� private short dayOfYear -- (1 - 365 or 366)

� private short dayOfWeek -- (0 - 6 -- 0 is Sunday)

methods:

� 4 constructors -- one default, and ones with 1 (month), 2 (month, year), 
  and 3 (dayOfMonth, month, year) parameters. 
  All four constructors should begin by calling setCurrentDate(). 
  Any out-of-range parameter will cause the object to remain as the current date.

� public static boolean isLeapYear -- takes in a year. 
  The rule is: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 unless 
  it divisible by 100 except if it is also divisible by 400.

� public static short daysInMonth -- takes in a month number and a year 
  and uses a switch to send back the proper number of days.

� private static short countLeaps -- takes in a year 
  and returns the number of leap years from the base year to it.

An easy algorithm is to start at 1760 (which was a leap year) and 
loop through all of the years to the year sent in, 
adding one to your count if isleapyear(yearTested).

� Accessors and Mutators (sets and gets) for the appropriate properties. 
  Make sure that mutators change values ONLY if the values are valid and 
  that all properties remain consistent with each other. 
  See the descriptions forsetDayOfYear and setDayOfWeek below.

� public DateAD getYesterday -- returns a DateAD representing the day before this day.

� public DateAD getTomorrow -- returns a DateAD representing the day after this day.

� public boolean lessThan -- returns a true if this day comes 
  before the DateAD passed in as an argument; false otherwise.

� public boolean equals -- returns a true if this day is the same day 
  as the DateAD passed in as an argument; false otherwise.

� public String toString -- returns the day-of-week, day-of-month, 
  month, year (as text), e.g., "Tuesday, 2 January, 2007"; overrides Object.toString()

� public void setCurrentDate() (requires an import java.util.*;) 
  N.B.: The set of code given here is the ONLY place you are allowed to use the GregorianCalendar class.

	{
		GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar();
		
		month = (short)cal.get(GregorianCalendar.MONTH);
		
		year = (short)cal.get(GregorianCalendar.YEAR);
		
		dayOfMonth = (short)cal.get(GregorianCalendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
		
		// add your own additional code to properly set dayOfYear and dayOfWeek
		
		// DO NOT use the GregorianCalendar class to do this--do it yourself
	}

� private void setDayOfYear -- properly sets dayOfYear. (January 1 is day 1).

� private void setDayOfWeek -- properly sets dayOfWeek.

One algorithm is to start at January 1, 1760 (which was a Tuesday) 
and loop through all of the years to the year sent in, 
adding one to your count for each year (one more if isleapyear(yearTested). 
Then add in dayOfTheYear and mod by DAYS_IN_A_WEEK.
